### **STEP 5: Get Your Public Key**

### **STEP 6: Update Your Code**

Once you have all three credentials, send them to me:
- âœ… Service ID
- âœ… Template ID (order_notification)
- âœ… Template ID (customer_confirmation)  
- âœ… Public Key

And I'll update your `email-service.js` file with the correct values!

---

## Quick Reference - What Goes Where:

```javascript
this.serviceId = 'YOUR_SERVICE_ID';        // From Step 2
this.templateId = 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID';      // From Step 3 (order_notification)
this.publicKey = 'YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY';        // From Step 5
```

The customer confirmation template ID goes in line 71 of email-service.js.
